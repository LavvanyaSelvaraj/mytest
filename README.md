In this test code, first created an instance of the "RecentlyPlayedSongsStore" class with an initial capacity of 3, then used a WebDriver instance to navigate to a website where the songs can be played. Then play four songs - S1, S2, S3, and S4. After each song is played, used the store.getRecentSongs method to verify that the recent songs list for the user is correct. Finally, closed the browser window.
